<h3>

I studied Mathematics at the University of Bologna, in Italy and I am finishing my PhD in Computer Science at the Graz University of Technology, in Austria. In my work, I like to show how computational methods can be applied to gain insights into linguistic knowledge and vice versa, how linguistics can be use to enhance NLP tools.</h5>

<h5>I have always had a passion for language and in general for everything that has to do with the act of writing. For example, I have always loved writing letters to my friends and sending them by post (even if it was already old fashioned when I started), I was into calligraphy before it become a trend, I love reading anything I can find and I notice and remember people's handwriting (my high school math teacher had the best handwriting I have ever seen - maybe that's why I chose to study Mathematics ;) ). I have always thought that my job would have been related to what I studied, math, and that my free time would be massively dedicated to my second passion, reading. I never thought that there could have been a way of connecting those two so different interests. Unexpectedly, during the first year of my Master's I discovered the existence of NLP. It was so surprising because I expected Mathematics to be applicable to anything that is in some way measurable and quantifiable but I never expected that it could also be applied to the most unquantifiable thing I knew: writing! That shocking finding changed my idea about my future. I got very exicted about NLP, and I still am. Lately, I got more interested into Computational Linguistics, because I find it a more interesting field than NLP, being now only a search for the best performance.

My long-term aim is to bring computational and data science approaches into linguistics, which I try to do in my PhD thesis. I will soon graduate at the Graz University for Technology and I have started a PostDoc at IIASA, the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. In this project, I try to use social media data to draw insights into people's changing behaviors and risk perception with respect to climate change.</h3></p>
